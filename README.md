Extract archives without having to worry about different `tar` parameters, or whether you should use a subdirectory or not.

ext extracts files to your CWD if there's only one directory or file in there, and to a subfolder if there's more.


### Setup

```
$ pip3 install ext
```


### Usage

```
$ ext [pathtoarchive]
```

Supports rars, zips and tarballs.
